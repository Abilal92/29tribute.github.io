				<h3>Khabib vs Gaethje</h3>
				<p>Gaethje was roped into the fray on short notice and never stood a chance against Khabib who, unbeknownst to most, was planning on retiring after the fight.</p>

				<h3>Khabib vs Dustin Poirier</h3>
				<p>There were few occasions over the course of his career where Khabib looked to be in a spot of bother.

               However, Dustin Poirier did come agonisingly close to submitting the Russian to snap his proud unbeaten record. </p>

				<h3>Khabib vs McGregor</h3>
				<p>There was only ever going to be one winner here.

               Khabib's fight with bitter rival McGregor is the highest-grossing pay-per-view in the history of the UFC.</p>

				<h3>Khabib vs Al laquinta</h3>
				<p>The fight went the distance with Al laquinta more than holding his own.
               However, the scorecards would reveal that Khabib had won all five rounds, showing just how mentally tough he was following a seven-day period that could have completely derailed his preparations for the fight.</p>

				<h3>Khabib vs Edson Barboza</h3>
				<p>At the time, Khabib labelled this particular fight his 'most dominance performance yet'.
               Khabib overwhelmed Barboza, executing every aspect of his game to perfection to make the judges job an easy one.</p>

				<h3>Khabib vs Darell Horcher</h3>
				<p>Florida was the stage for yet another show of sheer lightweight domination from 'The Eagle'.
               Horcher simply couldn't handle the physical speed and prowess of Khabib, with the fight ending in a TKO.</p>

				<h3>Khabib vs Michael Johnson</h3>
				<p>Number one rule when fighting Khabib? Don't let it go to ground.

               Michael Johnson learned that lesson the hard way after a promising start against Nurmagomedov.</p>
